**===================singleTon Design Patter =============================**

Singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created.

Advantages of Singleton Design Pattern
* Singleton pattern can implement interfaces.
* Can be lazy-loaded and has Static Initialization.
* It helps to hide dependencies.
* It provides a single point of access to a particular instance, so it is easy to maintain.

Disadvantages of Singleton Design Pattern
-- Unit testing is a bit difficult as it introduces a global state into an application
-- Reduces the potential for parallelism within a program by locking.

The following compares Singleton class vs. Static methods,
-- A Static Class cannot be extended whereas a singleton class can be extended.
-- A Static Class cannot be initialized whereas a singleton class can be.
-- A Static class is loaded automatically by the CLR when the program containing the class is loaded.

```

public sealed class SingleTon
{
    private static SingleTon _instance = null;
    private static readonly Object padlock = new Object();

    private SingleTon() { }

    public static SingleTon Instance{
        get{
            lock(padlock)
            {
                if(_instance == null){
                    _instance = new SingleTon();
                }
                return _instance;
            }
    }
} 

```
**======================C# Factory Method Design Pattern======================**

The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

```

public interface INotification
{
    void SendNotification();
}


public class EmailNotification : INotification
{
    public void SendNotification
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sending email notification")
    }
}


public class SMSNotification : INotification
{
    public void SendNotification()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sending sms notification");   
    }
}


public abstract class NotificationFactory
{
    public abstract INotification CreateNotification();
}

public class EmailNotificationFactory : INotificationFactory
{
    public override INotification CreateNotification()
    {
        return new EmailNotification();
    }
}


public SMSNotificationFactory : NotificationFactory
{
    public overide INotification CreateNotification()
    {
        return SMSNotification();
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Notificationfactory emailFactory = new EmailNotificationFactory();
        INotification emailNotification = emailFactory.createNotification();
        emailNotification.SendNotification();

        NotificationFactory smsFactory = new SMSNotificationFactory();
        INotification smsNotification = smsFactory.CreateNotification();
        smsNotification.SendNotification();
    }
}

```

**===============Abstract Factory===================**

The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

```
public interface INotification
{
    void Send();
}


public void EmailNotification : INotification
{
    public void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sending email notification");
    }
}


public void SMSNotification : INotification
{
    public void Send()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Send SMS notification")
    }
}

public interface INotificationFactory
{
    INotification CreateEmailNotification();
    INotification CreateSMSNotification();
}

public class NotificationFactory : INotificationFactory
{
    public INotification CreateEmailNotification()
    {
         return new EmailNotification();
    }

    public INotification CreateSMSNotification()
    {
        return new SMSNotification();
    }
}

class Program
{
    //create a notification factory

    INotificationFactory notificationFactory = new NotificationFactory();

    //create an email notification
    INotification emailNotification = notificationFactory.createEmailNotification();
    emailNotification.Send();

    //create an SMS notification
    INotification smsNotification = notificationFactory.createSMSNotification();
    smsNotification.Send();
}

```
**===================================Builder design pattern===========================================**

The Builder design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

**Builder :** This is an interface which is used to define all the steps required to create a product.

**ConcreteBuilder :** This is a class which implements the Builder interface to create a complex product.

**Product :** This is a class which defines the parts of the complex object which are to be generated by the Builder Pattern.

**Director :** This is a class that is used to construct an object using the Builder interface.

 
**WHEN TO USE THIS PATTERN :** When we need to create a complex object in several steps (a step by step approach).

**ADVANTAGES**

- Code is more maintainable and readable.

- Less prone to errors as we have a method which returns the finally constructed object.

**DISADVANTAGES**

- Number of lines of code increases in builder pattern, but it makes sense as the effort pays off in terms of maintainability and readability.

**Conclusion**

So, if your object has only a few constructor arguments, it makes no sense to use the builder pattern. Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors have more than a handful of parameters.

```
using System;
					
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		var builder = new NotificationBuilder();
		var director = new Director(builder);
		director.ConstructNotification("Greetings", "Greetings of the day!", "test@gmail.com");
		var notification = builder.Build();	
		notification.PrintDetails();
	}
}

//product
public class Notification
{
	public string Title {get;set;}
	public string Body {get;set;}
	public string Recipient {get;set;}
	
	public void PrintDetails()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Title : "+ Title + " Body : " + Body+ "Receipient "+ Recipient);
	}
}

//builder interface
public interface INotificationBuilder
{
	void SetTitle(string title);
	void SetBody(string body);
	void SetRecipient(string recipient);
	
	Notification Build();
}

public class NotificationBuilder : INotificationBuilder
{
	private Notification _notification = new Notification();
	
	public void SetTitle(string title)
	{
		_notification.Title = title;	
	}
	
	public void SetBody(string body)
	{
		_notification.Body = body;
	}
	
	public void SetRecipient( string recipient)
	{
		_notification.Recipient = recipient;
	}
	
	public Notification Build()
	{
		return _notification;
	}
}

//Director
public class Director
{
	private INotificationBuilder _builder;
	public Director(INotificationBuilder notificationBuilder)
	{
		_builder = notificationBuilder;
	}
	
	public void ConstructNotification(string title, string body, string recipient)
	{
		_builder.SetTitle(title);
		_builder.SetBody(body);
		_builder.SetRecipient(recipient);
	}
	
}

```

**==================================Adapter Design Pattern============**

The Adapter design pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. This design pattern lets classes work together that couldnâ€˜t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

The Adapter Design pattern is a structural pattern that allows object with incompatible interfaces to work together.It acts as bridge between the old and new interfaces, enabling them to collaborate seamlessly.

```

public interface IWeatherService
{
    float GetTemperatureInCelsius();
}

public class FarenheitWeatherServiceAdapter : IWeatherService
{
    private readonly ExternalWeatherService _externalWeatherService;

    public FarenheitWeatherServiceAdapter(ExternalWeatherService externalService){

        _externalService = externalService;
    }

    public float GetTemperatureInCelsius(){

        //convert Farenheit to celcius

        float temperatureInFarenheit = _externalWeatherService.GetTemperature();

        return (temperatur - 32) *5 / 9;

    }

}

```
**======================================================Bridge Design Patter =================================================**

The Bridge design pattern allows you to separate the abstraction from the implementation,so that the two can vary independently.

The bridge design pattern is a type of structural design pattern which is used to split a large class into two separate inheritance hierarchies (a collection of 'is-a' relationships); one for the implementations and one for the abstractions. These hierarchies are then connected to each other via object composition, forming a bridge-like structure. This pattern is also known as the Handle-Body Design Pattern.

``` 
namespace BridgePatternRealTimeExample
{
    /** 
    This is going to be an interface that acts as a bridge between the Abstraction Layer and Implementation Layer
    The following Implementor Interface defines the operations for all implementation classes. It doesn't have to match the Abstraction's interface.
    In fact, the two interfaces can be entirely different.
     **/

    public interface IMessageSender
    {
        void SendMessage(string Message);

**=================================================Facade Design Patter ============================================================**

Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system. Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system making it easier to use.

This pattern involves a single wrapper class which contains a set of members which are required by the client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.

The facade design pattern is particularly used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable.

Facade Design pattern falls under Structural Pattern. The Facade design pattern is particularly used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable.
 

Example without using Facade Design Pattern
 
```
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    public class Customer
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
        public string Address { get; set; }
        //Any other Properties as per the Business Requirements
    }
}


using System;
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    public class Validator
    {
        public bool ValidateCustomer(Customer customer)
        {
            //Need to Validate the Customer Object
            Console.WriteLine("Customer Validated...");
            Console.WriteLine($"Name:{customer.Name}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Email:{customer.Email}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Mobile:{customer.MobileNumber}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Address:{customer.Address}");

            return true;
        }
    }
}

using System;
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    public class CustomerDataAccessLayer
    {
        public bool SaveCustomer(Customer customer)
        {
            //Save the Customer in the Database
            Console.WriteLine("\nCustomer Saved into the Database...");

            return true;
        }
    }
}

using System;
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    public class Email
    {
        public bool SendRegistrationEmail(Customer customer)
        {
            //Send Registration Successful Email to Customer
            Console.WriteLine("\nRegistration Email Send to Customer...");

            return true;
        }
    }
}

 
            Customer customer = new Customer()
using System;
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step1: Create an Instance of Customer Class
            {
                Name = "Pranaya",
                Email = info@dotnettutorials.net,
                MobileNumber = "1234567890",
                Address = "BBSR, Odisha, India"
            };

            //Step2: Validate the Customer
            Validator validator = new Validator();
            bool IsValid = validator.ValidateCustomer(customer);

            //Step3: Save the Customer Object into the database
            CustomerDataAccessLayer customerDataAccessLayer = new CustomerDataAccessLayer();
            bool IsSaved = customerDataAccessLayer.SaveCustomer(customer);

            //Step4: Send the Registration Email to the Customer
            Email email = new Email();
            email.SendRegistrationEmail(customer);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```

**Problem with the above Design :**

The problem is now we have many subsystems like Validator, CustomerDataAccessLayer, and Email. And the Client needs to follow the appropriate sequence to create and consume the objects of the above subsystems. And here, there is a high chance that the client might not follow the proper sequence, or the client might forget to use one of the subsystems.

 

Implementing Facade Design Pattern:

```
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    public class CustomerRegistration
    {
        public bool RegisterCustomer(Customer customer)
        {
            //Step1: Validate the Customer
            Validator validator = new Validator();
            bool IsValid = validator.ValidateCustomer(customer);

            //Step1: Save the Customer Object into the database
            CustomerDataAccessLayer customerDataAccessLayer = new CustomerDataAccessLayer();
            bool IsSaved = customerDataAccessLayer.SaveCustomer(customer);

            //Step3: Send the Registration Email to the Customer
            Email email = new Email();
            email.SendRegistrationEmail(customer);

            return true;
        }
    }
}

 
using System;
namespace FacadeDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Create an Instance of Customer Class
            Customer customer = new Customer()
            {
                Name = "Pranaya",
                Email = info@dotnettutorials.net,
                MobileNumber = "1234567890",
                Address = "BBSR, Odisha, India"
            };

            //Using Facade Class
            CustomerRegistration customerRegistration = new CustomerRegistration();
            customerRegistration.RegisterCustomer(customer);

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}

```
**=================================================Decorator Design Pattern ============================================================**

The Decorator Design Pattern allows us to dynamically add new functionalities to an existing object without altering or modifying its structure. This design pattern acts as a wrapper to the existing class. That means the Decorator Design Pattern dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting the existing functionality of the object.

In short, this design pattern adds additional functionalities to the object by wrapping it. A decorator is an object that adds features to another object.

```
public interface Component
{
    void Operation();
}

public class ConcreteComponent : Component
{
    public void Operation()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Component Operation");
    }
}

public abstract class Decorator : Component
{
    private Component _component;
    
    public Decorator(Component component)
    {
        _component = component;
    }
    
    public virtual void Operation()
    {
        _component.Operation();
    }

}


public class ConcreteDecorator : Decorator
{
    public ConcreteDecorator(Component component) : base(component) { }
    
    public override void Operation()
    {
        base.Operation();
        
        Console.WriteLine("Override Decorator Operation");
    }
}

**Real life example **
Suppose you want to prepare either chicken pizza or vegetable pizza. Then what you need to do is, first you need to prepare the plain pizza. Then the Pizza Decorator will add chicken to the plain pizza if you want chicken pizza or it will add vegetables to the plain pizza if you want vegetable pizza. So, you are getting chicken pizza or vegetable pizza by adding chicken or vegetables to the plain pizza by the Pizza decorator.

 
Step1: Creating the Pizza interface (Component)

namespace DecoratorDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    // This is the Base Component interface that defines operations that can be altered by decorators

    public interface Pizza
    {
        string MakePizza();
    }
}

 
Step2: Creating Plain Pizza (Concrete Component)

namespace DecoratorDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    // This is the Base Component interface that defines operations that can be altered by decorators

    public interface Pizza
    {
        string MakePizza();
    }
}

Step3: Creating Pizza Decorator (Decorator)

namespace DecoratorDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    //Inherited from the Base Component Interface

    public abstract class PizzaDecorator : Pizza
    {
        //Create a Field to store the existing Pizza Object

        protected Pizza pizza;
        
        //Initializing the Field using Constructor
        //While Creating an instance of the PizzaDecorator (Instance of the Child Class that Implements PizzaDecorator abstract class)
        //We need to pass the existing pizza object which we want to decorate

        public PizzaDecorator(Pizza pizza)
        {
            //Store that existing pizza object in the pizza variable
            
            this.pizza = pizza;
        }

        //Providing Implementation for Pizza Interface i.e. MakePizza Method
        //Here, we are just calling the Concrete Component ManufactureCar Method using the existing pizza object
        //We are making this Method Virtual to allow the Child Concrete Decorator classes to override

        public virtual string MakePizza()
        {
            return pizza.MakePizza();
        }
    }
}

 

Step4: Creating Chicken Pizza Decorator (ConcreteDecoratorA )

namespace DecoratorDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{
    //The following Concrete Decorator class will add Chicken to Existing Pizza

    public class ChickenPizzaDecorator : PizzaDecorator
    {
        //Pass the existing pizza while creating the Instance of ChickenPizzaDecorator
        //Also pass the same existing pizza object to the base constructor

        public ChickenPizzaDecorator(Pizza pizza) : base(pizza)
        {
        }


        public override string MakePizza()
        {
        //Overriding the MakePizza method to Chicken
            //First Call the Concrete Components MakePizza Method and then the AddChicken method

            return pizza.MakePizza() + AddChicken();
        }


        private string AddChicken()
        {
            return ", Chicken added";
        }
    }
}

 

Step5: Creating Veg Pizza Decorator (ConcreteDecoratorB)

namespace DecoratorDesignPatternRealTimeExample
{

    //The following Concrete Decorator class will add Vegetables to the Existing Pizza

    public class VegPizzaDecorator : PizzaDecorator
    {
        //Pass the existing pizza object while creating the Instance of VegPizzaDecorator class
        //Also pass the same existing pizza object to the base class constructor

        public VegPizzaDecorator(Pizza pizza) : base(pizza)
        {
        }

        //Overriding the MakePizza method to Vegetables

        public override string MakePizza()
        {
            //First Call the Concrete Components MakePizza Method and then the AddVegetables method

            return pizza.MakePizza() + AddVegetables();
        }

**=================================================Explain Circuit Breaker Design Pattern in Microservices ? ======================**
**Circuit Breaker Pattern Overview**
The circuit breaker pattern works similarly to an electrical circuit breaker. It monitors for failures in a service call and, when certain thresholds are met, it "trips" the breaker to prevent further calls to the failing service. This allows the failing service time to recover, and avoids overloading it with additional requests.

The circuit breaker has three states:
-- **Closed:** Requests are allowed to pass through. If the requests succeed, the circuit remains closed.
--  **Open:** Requests are blocked and an error is returned immediately without attempting the call. This state is triggered when a threshold of failures is reached.
-- **Half-Open:** A limited number of test requests are allowed through to see if the service has recovered. If these requests succeed, the circuit breaker resets to the closed state. If they fail, the circuit breaker returns to the open state.

**Implementing Circuit Breaker in .NET Core**
In .NET Core, you can implement the circuit breaker pattern using the Polly library. Polly is a .NET resilience and transient fault-handling library that allows you to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback.

**Steps to Implement Circuit Breaker with Polly**
-- Install Polly NuGet Package:
First, install the Polly NuGet package in your .NET Core project:

```
dotnet add package Polly

```
-- Configure Circuit Breaker Policy:
Define a circuit breaker policy in your code. This policy specifies the number of exceptions allowed before opening the circuit, the duration the circuit remains open, and the actions to take on transitions.
```
using Polly;
using Polly.CircuitBreaker;

// Define a circuit breaker policy
var circuitBreakerPolicy = Policy
    .Handle<Exception>()
    .CircuitBreakerAsync(
        exceptionsAllowedBeforeBreaking: 3,
        durationOfBreak: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
        onBreak: (exception, timespan) => {
            // Code to run when the circuit breaks
            Console.WriteLine("Circuit broken!");
        },
        onReset: () => {
            // Code to run when the circuit resets
            Console.WriteLine("Circuit reset!");
        },
        onHalfOpen: () => {
            // Code to run when the circuit is half-open
            Console.WriteLine("Circuit half-open, testing...");
        });

```
-- Use Circuit Breaker Policy in Your HTTP Calls:
Apply the circuit breaker policy to your HTTP calls. You can wrap your HttpClient calls with the circuit breaker policy.
```
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class ApiService
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;
    private readonly AsyncCircuitBreakerPolicy _circuitBreakerPolicy;

    public ApiService(HttpClient httpClient, AsyncCircuitBreakerPolicy circuitBreakerPolicy)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
        _circuitBreakerPolicy = circuitBreakerPolicy;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetDataAsync(string url)
    {
        return await _circuitBreakerPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () => {
            var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync(url);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
            return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        });
    }
}

```
-- Register Services in Dependency Injection:
Register your HttpClient and ApiService with dependency injection in the Startup class.

```
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddHttpClient<ApiService>()
            .AddPolicyHandler(circuitBreakerPolicy);
    }
}

```
**Example Usage**
Hereâ€™s how you might use the ApiService in a controller:
```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ApiService _apiService;

    public MyController(ApiService apiService)
    {
        _apiService = apiService;
    }

    [HttpGet("data")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetData()
    {
        try
        {
            var data = await _apiService.GetDataAsync("https://api.example.com/data");
            return Ok(data);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle exceptions, e.g., log error and return appropriate response
            return StatusCode(500, "Internal server error");
        }
    }
}

```
Benefits
-- Resilience: Prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to services that are down.
-- Recovery: Allows services to recover gracefully without being overwhelmed.
-- Monitoring: Provides hooks to monitor the state and behavior of service calls.
By implementing the circuit breaker pattern with Polly in .NET Core, you can significantly enhance the reliability and resilience of your microservice architecture.
